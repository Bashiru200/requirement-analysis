# 📌 Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## 📝 Introduction

This repository is dedicated to exploring and documenting the **Requirement Analysis** phase in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**. Requirement analysis is a critical stage where project goals, user expectations, and system constraints are gathered and evaluated to form a solid foundation for successful software design and development.

Here, you will find:

- ✅ Definitions and types of software requirements  
- 🔍 Techniques for gathering and analyzing requirements  
- 📊 Use case diagrams, user stories, and requirement documents  
- 🛠️ Tools and best practices for effective requirement management

Whether you're a software engineering student, an aspiring product manager, or a developer looking to strengthen your SDLC knowledge — this repo is a great place to start.

## 1. Requirements Analysis

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of **identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting** what a software system needs to do to meet the expectations of users and stakeholders.

It’s one of the first and most critical stages in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), laying the foundation for how the software will be designed, built, and tested.

🔍 **Why is Requirement Analysis Important?**

🚫 Prevents misunderstandings between developers and stakeholders

💡 Helps define the scope and objectives of the project

💰 Saves time and money by reducing the chances of rework

📋 Provides clear documentation for design, testing, and deployment


## 📌 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis is not a single step — it's a structured set of activities that help ensure a deep understanding of what a software system needs to do. Below are the five key activities typically involved:

---

### 1. 📝 Requirement Gathering

This is the process of **collecting raw requirements** from various stakeholders, including clients, users, and subject matter experts.

**Goals:**
- Understand the problem the software must solve
- Identify all potential stakeholders
- Collect existing documentation or system behavior

**Common Techniques:**
- Interviews
- Surveys and questionnaires
- Document review
- Observations

---

### 2. 🗣️ Requirement Elicitation

Elicitation goes beyond simple collection — it's about **drawing out** the real needs behind what stakeholders *say*. Often, users don’t always know exactly what they need, or they may express it in ambiguous terms.

**Goals:**
- Uncover hidden or implicit requirements
- Clarify conflicting inputs
- Prioritize needs

**Common Techniques:**
- Brainstorming
- Use case development
- Joint Application Development (JAD) sessions
- Prototyping

---

### 3. 🧾 Requirement Documentation

Once requirements are gathered and clarified, they must be **formally documented** in a clear, structured, and accessible way.

**Goals:**
- Provide a written reference for designers, developers, and testers
- Ensure traceability and accountability
- Create a single source of truth for the project

**Examples of Artifacts:**
- Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
- User Stories
- Use Case Diagrams
- Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)

---

### 4. 📊 Requirement Analysis and Modeling

This activity involves **analyzing the documented requirements** to identify overlaps, gaps, contradictions, and ambiguities. It may also include **modeling** them to better understand relationships, processes, and data flows.

**Goals:**
- Ensure feasibility and consistency
- Identify risks and dependencies
- Visualize system behavior

**Tools & Models Used:**
- Flowcharts
- Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)
- UML Diagrams (e.g., use case, activity, class diagrams)
- State transition diagrams

---

### 5. ✅ Requirement Validation

Before moving into design or development, the final step is to **validate** the requirements with stakeholders to ensure they are correct, complete, and agreed upon.

**Goals:**
- Catch misunderstandings early
- Confirm that documented requirements match stakeholder expectations
- Avoid costly changes later in the project

**Validation Techniques:**
- Reviews and walkthroughs
- Prototypes or mockups
- Acceptance criteria and sign-off sessions

---

Together, these five activities help create a strong foundation for building reliable, user-centered, and successful software systems.

## 🧩 Types of Requirements

In software development, requirements are typically categorized into two main types: **Functional Requirements** and **Non-Functional Requirements**. Both are essential to building a complete and reliable system.

---

### ✅ Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define **what the system should do** — the specific behaviors, features, and functions the software must support.

These requirements directly relate to the **core operations of the booking management system**.

#### 💡 Examples (Booking Management Project):

- 🔐 **User Authentication**: The system must allow users to register, log in, and manage their profiles.
- 📅 **Booking Creation**: Users must be able to create new bookings for available listings.
- 🗓️ **View Availability**: The system should display available dates for a selected listing.
- ✏️ **Update Booking**: Users should be able to modify their bookings before a specified cutoff time.
- ❌ **Cancel Booking**: The system should allow users to cancel an existing booking.
- 📩 **Email Notifications**: The system must send confirmation emails upon successful booking or cancellation.

These requirements drive the primary functionality that the software delivers to end-users.

---

### ⚙️ Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements describe **how** the system performs its functions rather than what the system does. They refer to **quality attributes**, constraints, and system behaviors under specific conditions.

#### 💡 Examples (Booking Management Project):

- 🚀 **Performance**: The system should handle up to 1,000 concurrent users during peak hours without lag.
- 🔐 **Security**: All user data, including login credentials and booking details, must be stored securely using encryption.
- 🕒 **Availability**: The booking system must be accessible 99.9% of the time throughout the year.
- 📱 **Responsiveness**: The application must load on mobile devices in under 2 seconds.
- 🧪 **Maintainability**: Code should follow modular design and include unit tests for core features.
- 🌐 **Scalability**: The system should be capable of supporting new listings and users without major architectural changes.

Non-functional requirements ensure that the system is robust, reliable, and delivers a high-quality user experience.

---

Together, functional and non-functional requirements help define both **what** the system will do and **how well** it will perform.

##  Use Case Diagrams

### What Are Use Case Diagrams?

A **Use Case Diagram** is a visual representation, created using UML (Unified Modeling Language), that illustrates how different users (actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals (use cases). Actors are represented as stick figures, use cases are drawn as ovals, and the system boundary defines the scope of these interactions.:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

1. **Improved Communication**  
   They provide a clear, visual language that bridges understanding between developers, stakeholders, and non-technical users.:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

2. **Effective Requirement Gathering**  
   Use cases help uncover and capture functional requirements by illustrating how users will interact with the system.:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

3. **Guides System Design & Testing**  
   Use Case Diagrams help in designing user interfaces, organizing functionalities, and forming the basis for test scenarios.:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

4. **Easy Validation & Maintenance**  
   By visualizing interactions, stakeholders can easily spot missing, conflicting, or ambiguous requirements early in the development process, and the diagram remains a great reference for future enhancements.:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

### Use Case Diagram for Booking Management System

Below is a sketch of what your Use Case Diagram could include. Imagine the system boundary includes the booking management system. Actors and main use cases could be:

- **Actors**:
  - **User** (e.g., Customer)
  - **Admin**
  - **Email Service** (external system for notifications)

- **Use Cases**:
  - Register / Login
  - View Listings
  - Create Booking
  - Modify / Update Booking
  - Cancel Booking
  - Send Booking Confirmation (triggered via Email Service)

Once you design this diagram in a tool like **Draw.io**, **Lucidchart**, or **Miro**, export it as `alx-booking-uc.png` and add it here:
